Part 1:
A user can share a photo by "either" sharing a photo via the camera or sharing it via the gallery ,but for that last option they must select an image from the gallery

An administrator can include their position in a shared text ,but only if geolocation is enabled

Correct(because of "other " in the sentence,thus logging in is not included in here)

Actors can share a photo directly via the device (camera)

When the geolocation is disabled the user can share text but without their geolocation


Part2:
The arrow for include must be a continue line,where in this diagram it is not
